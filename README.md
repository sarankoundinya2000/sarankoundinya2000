## Hi there üëã, I am Saran Koundinya

# üí´ About Me:
üî≠ I‚Äôm currently working on building LLMs from scratch, making websites accessible to visually impaired users with generative AI, and designing efficient MLOps pipelines.  
üå± I‚Äôm learning about generative AI, LLMs, and Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Agentic RAG).  
üí¨ You can ask me about reinforcement learning, fine-tuning LLMs, or building RAG pipelines using various APIs.  
‚ö° I created **AutogitPy**, a Python library for simplifying Git operations with just a few commands.  
‚ú® I enjoy merging AI with real-world applications, like creating a car showroom voice assistant to compare products and book appointments!
